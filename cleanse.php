							Every day you are exposed to some type of toxin – whether it be environmental pollution, cigarette smoke, 
							household cleaning products, chemicals found in drinking water or food, heavy metals, aluminum from cans, 
							radiation from microwaves and cell phones, just to name a few!
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Many other health conditions such as fatigue, joint discomfort, digestive issues, hormonal imbalances and 
							even brain fog can be linked to excessive toxicity.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Not to mention, certain toxins are stored in your fat cells. This provides even more incentive to do what 
							most Americans struggle with: exercising regularly, which can help with both your weight loss and cleansing goals.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, toxicity doesn't just affect adults! It's also causing great harm to our children. Childhood 
							cognitive issues have skyrocketed over the past 20 years and more children are overweight today than ever 
							before. I believe a major reason for this is due to the accumulation of toxins in our bodies, and this can 
							even start at birth!
						</p><br>
						<p>
							According to health expert Dr. Daniel Pompa, “True cleansing starts at the cellular level.” Your body is made 
							up of 75 trillion cells and in order for you to be healthy, your cells must be healthy. A healthy cell is able 
							to bring nutrients in and push toxins out. If your cells are unable to accomplish this task, your health will suffer.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Regular cleansing is the best way to support detoxification of the colon, liver, kidneys and lymphatic system. 
							Some of the most well respected natural health experts including Dr. Bernard Jensen, Dr. Paul Bragg, Dr. Norman 
							Walker, Dr. Ann Wigmore, V.E. Irons and many others believe that the first step to achieving the health of your 
							dreams is by cleansing.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Three of the key requirements for clean and healthy cells are:

							<ul>
								<li>Proper hydration</li>
								<li>A correct ration of the electrolytes sodium and potassium</li>
								<li>Balanced intestinal flora</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>
							The SueroViv 3-Day Cleanse provides these three essential requirements, and is designed to support the body's 
							natural cleansing and detoxification systems and help you reach a higher level of health than you've ever experienced!
