					<p>Infrared body wraps are thermal body wraps that are performed through the use of a 3 zone thermal blanket. 
						The thermal blanket provides radiant heat. Unlike a traditional body wrap, the Infrared Body Wrap can 
						be used alone or in conjunction with herbal body gel applied to the skin. The Infrared Body Wrap can 
						treat the entire body or targeted zones. Although the Infrared Body Wrap provides detoxification and 
						permanent inch loss, they are also best served for those who want to treat pain. The Infrared Body Wrap 
						process has been proven to treat chronic and acute pain like muscle strains and joint sprains. The 
						Infrared Body Wrap will definitely aid in weight loss and will help you burn body fat in every session. 
						That is an added bonus when you simply can't make it to the gym for your normal workout!</p><br>
					<p>The purpose of the Infrared Body Wrap is to apply heat to the body in order to get underneath the fat 
						tissue and thin the blood to allow it to get into the areas where fat tissue exists. Bringing the blood 
						back into the areas that have had restricted blood flow causes the metabolism rates to rise. The heat 
						softens the fat tissue causing it to break up and be released into the blood stream in the form of 
						calories to be burned up as energy. When we have an excess of calories, the body stores them as fat. 
						The Infrared Body Wrap reverses this process by breaking the fat down into calories and placing them 
						back into the blood stream to be used as energy.</p><br>
					<p>You can burn from 900 to 1400 calories (depending on individual body metabolism) or more in just one 
						45 minute session.</p><br>
					<p>Infrared energy increases the body's molecular vibration by actually vibrating the cell structure to help break the connections between deposits, such as fats and toxins, generating heat which is absorbed through the skin. Continuous vibration of the body's molecules does the following:</p>
					<ul class="content_list">
						<li>Increases dermis temperature</li>
						<li>Enlarges blood vessels</li>
						<li>Stimulates blood circulation</li>
						<li>Activates metabolism in tissues and cells</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This process provides therapeutic and tissue regenerative properties when humans absorb the energy.When the Infrared Sauna Blanket applies infrared heat deep into the body where fat tissues exist, the result is increased metabolism rates causing fat tissue to break up, burning excess calories as energy. The Infrared Body Wrap system enables the system to aid in:</p>
					<ul class="content_list">
						<li>Weight Loss</li>
						<li>Body Contouring/Reshaping</li>
						<li>Fat &amp; inch loss</li>
						<li>Pain Relief</li>
						<li>Detoxification</li>
						<li>Skin Enhancement</li>
						<li>Improved appearance of cellulite</li>
					</ul>
